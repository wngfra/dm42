# PROGRAMS
1. `factor` - factorize the integer in stack X
2. `fibonacci` - compute N-th Fibonacci number 
3. `lcmgcd` - compute least common multiplier and greatest common divisor of stack X and Y; store the results in stack X and Y
4. `pdv` - compute present discounted value; `PMT` as periodic payment; `ADR%` as annual discount rate in percentage; `N` as period in months; results are stored in `PVB` as present value with begin payment, `PVE` as present value with end payment, `FVB` as future value with begin payment and `FVE` as future value with end payment
5. `quad` - quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ solver
6. `Sequence` - a set of functions for sequence; $\sum$ summation over function `FCN`; `PROD` product over function `FCN`; starts from `LLIM` to `ULIM` with step `ACC`

# STATE
1. `default` - default state with custom keys
